This repo is a test-focused sprint designed to educate you about javascript bitcoin developer opportunities. Libraries include:

bitcoin-js (?)
Helloblock API

Write your code in mainBTC.js and try to make the specs pass. Run tests in node using npm test.

Brief overview of sprint:
  Create a bitcoin wallet
  Handle transactions
    ^ for testnet
