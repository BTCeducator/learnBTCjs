## Why ?
This repo is a test-focused sprint designed to educate javascript developers about two helpful bitcoin libraries:

Bitcoin-js
Helloblock

## To learn:
Fork the repo and clone it to your local machine. From the root directory, run `npm install` to install library dependencies

This repo contains 2 mostly empty files and a lot of failing tests.
Write your code in MakeWallet.js + Transaction.js and try to make the specs pass. Run tests in node using `npm test`.
Make sure you have mocha installed globally:
`npm install -g mocha`

Stuck? Visit bitcoinjs.org for hints

After this sprint you'll know Bitcoin-js and Helloblock libraries well enough to make a wallet, build transactions, and broadcast those transactions to the network

##But what is Bitcoin?
